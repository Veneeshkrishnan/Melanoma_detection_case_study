## General-information:
* Melanoma is a less common, but more serious cancer. Malignant melanoma can most successfully be cured when diagnosed at an early stage. Early detection of skin cancers like melanoma is crucial to ensure high chances of survival for patients. Clinical application of Deep Learning based decision support system for skin cancer screening has potential to improve the quality of patient care.

* Our aim is to build a CNN based model which can accurately predict the presence of melanoma and to provide a solution that can evaluate the images and alert dermatologist about the presence of melanoma which will reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Structure of Case study:
* Problem Statement
* Business Objectives
* Data Reading and Data Understanding
* Dataset Creation
* Dataset Visualization
* Base Model Building
* Data Augmentation
* Model Building using Augmented Data
* Class Distribution and Handling Class Imbalance
* Model Building using Balanced Data
* conclusion

## Conclusions:
* After applying data augmentation, we can see that the overfitting problem has resolved, as there is no high variance between training and validation loss.
* After using class rebalance techniques both the training accuracy and validation accuracy improved.
